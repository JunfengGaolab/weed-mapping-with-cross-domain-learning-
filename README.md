# Cross-domain transfer learning for weed segmentation and mapping in precision farming using ground and UAV images

Here we will release the codes for the submission ([Cross-domain transfer learning for weed segmentation and mapping in precision farming using ground and UAV images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11545)) in the Expert Systems with Applications

## Diagram of the study
The model was trained with ground images and it was able to predict UAV imagery for weed mapping.
